Some of the configurations are described below: 1. All in One single node installation: Both master and worker nodes components are installed and running on a single node. This is used during learning and testing, it is not advisable for production. 2. Single master and multi worker: Single master node managing multiple worker nodes. The single master node runs a multi-stacked etcd instance. 3. Single master with single node etcd and multi worker nodes: We have a single master node with an external etcd instance. This master node manages the multiple worker nodes. 4. Multi master and multi worker: This configuration is mainly used for high availability . Multi master nodes are configured with stacked etcd instances installed in each master node. It is recommended to install kubernetes on a multi host environment, with support for high availability control plane setups, and multiple worker nodes for client workload . Infrastructure We need to determine the infrastructure for installing kubernetes cluster. This is determined by the environment type e.g learning or production. We need to decide the following: 1. How we should setup kubernetes: On bare metal, public cloud, private or hybrid 2. OS type: Linux or Windows 3. Network solution Localhost Installation ● Minikube - single-node local kubernetes cluster, recommended for a learning environment deployed on a single host. ● Kind - multi-node kubernetes cluster deployed in docker containers, acting as kubernetes nodes, recommended for a learning environment. ● Docker Desktop - including a local kubernetes cluster for docker users. ● MicroK8s - local and cloud kubernetes cluster, from canonical. ● K3S - lightweight kubernetes cluster for local, cloud, edge, IoT deployments, from Rancher.',\n",
       "   \"Course: Introduction to Kubernetes L1:Introduction In this course, we will explore what kubernetes is; its architecture and building blocks, how it can be run on our local system or in the cloud, different ways we can configure and protect sensitive information, and how we can let external applications access our kubernetes application. We will also learn how to deploy and manage applications and resources with kubernetes. Here is a guide on how to create a GCP/Azure account Before diving into Kubernetes, we need to know some fundamental services that make working with Kubernetes easy and understandable. Containers Containers are an application-centric method used to deliver high-performing, scalable applications on any infrastructure of your choice. Containers provide a portable, isolated way of deploying microservices without disturbance from other microservices in our application. These containers install all the other dependencies needed by the microservice to function in a virtual environment. Containers are responsible for running container images, they do not run the microservices, rather, they couple the microservices and their dependencies. Container Images An image bundles the application with its runtime, libraries, and other dependencies. This serves as an isolated environment that runs the application. The runtime is the programming language that the application is built with or runs on. A container image represents binary data that encapsulates an application and all its software dependencies. Container images are executable software bundles that can run standalone and that make very well defined assumptions about their runtime environment. You typically create a container image of your application and push it to a registry before referring to it in a pod Microservices Microservices are simple, portable, and light applications written in major programming languages such as Rust, Go, Python, etc. Microservices have specific dependencies, libraries, and environmental requirements. Microservices must be deployed with their dependencies before they can successfully run.\\n\\nTools which group systems together to form clusters where containers' deployment and management is automated at scale are called a. DEployment b. Container c. Images d. Container orchestrators Question 4 What does a container image encapsulate? a. Represents a binary data that encapsulates an application and all its OS dependencies. b. Represents a binary data structure that encapsulates an application and all its binary dependencies c. Represents a binary data that encapsulates an application and all its Software dependencies. d. None of the above. Question 5 Simple, portable, and light applications written in major programming languages that also have specific dependencies, libraries, and environmental requirements are a. Microservices b. Containers c. Docker d. Images L2: Kubernetes Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Kubernetes can be referred to as k8s(pronounced Kate’s), 8 refers to the 8 characters between k and s. Kubernetes is an open source project started by Google and written in the Go programming language. The Kubernetes project was donated to the Cloud Native Computing foundation by Google, and new versions are released every 3 months. Features of Kubernetes Kubernetes offer a wide variety of features for orchestrating containers including: 1. Automatic bin packing: Containers are scheduled based on constraints and needed resources, this helps in maximizing utilization without sacrificing availability. 2. Self Healing: Kubernetes ensures a new pod is created to replace an unhealthy or a dead pod.\",\n",
       "   'On Premise Installation For on premises, kubernetes can be installed on VMs or bare metal On-premise VMs: K8s can be installed on VMs created via Vagrant, VMware vSphere, KVM, or a configuration tool in conjunction with a hypervisor. Bare Metal: K8s can be installed on premise bare metal hosted on top different os. Cloud Installation Kubernetes can be installed on almost any cloud production environment. A few of them are listed below. Hosted SolutionsWith Hosted Solutions, any given software is completely managed by the provider, while the user pays hosting and management charges. Popular vendors providing hosted solutions for Kubernetes are (listed in alphabetical order): Alibaba Cloud Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK) Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) DigitalOcean Kubernetes Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service Oracle Cloud Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE) Turnkey Cloud Solutions Below are only a few of the Turnkey Cloud Solutions (listed in alphabetical order), to install kubernetes on an underlying IaaS platform such as: Alibaba Cloud Amazon AWS (AWS EC2) Google Compute Engine (GCE) IBM Cloud Private Microsoft Azure (AKS).

       "   '\\nWe can stop minikube with Minikube stop Accessing Kubernetes Kubernetes cluster can be accessed using the following methods 1. Command Line Interface (CLI) 2. Web-based User Interface. 3. APIs from CLI or programmatically . CLI Kubectl is the only kubernetes command line interface client that is used to manage cluster resources and applications. It is easily integrated into other systems, can be used in a script or for automation. Kubectl has to be configured with the credentials of the kubernetes cluster before it can be used. Web-based UI Kubernetes has a web based UI that is used to manage, monitor, and containerize applications and resources in a cluster. API server This is the main component of the kubernetes control plane, its responsibility is exposing the kubernetes APIs. These APIs allow users to interact with clusters directly. The CLI tools and Dashboard UI can be used to access the API server and perform various operations on the nodes.',\n",
       "   '3. Horizontal scaling: Applications are scaled manually or automatically based on CPU or custom metrics utilization. 4. Service discovery and load balancing: Containers receive their own IP addresses from Kubernetes, while it assigns a single Domain Name System (DNS) name to a set of containers to aid in load-balancing requests across the containers of the set. 5. Automated rollouts and rollbacks: Seamless roll out and roll back application updates and configuration changes, constantly monitoring application health to prevent downtimes. 6. Storage orchestration: Mounts software-defined storage solutions to containers from local storage, external cloud providers, distributed storage, and network storage systems. 7. Batch execution: Kubernetes supports batch execution, long-running jobs, and replacement for failed containers. Architecture Kubernetes contains the following components at a high level 1. One or more master nodes. This is part of the control plane. 2. One or more worker nodes Master node: The master node is responsible for providing a running environment for the control plane. This control plane manages the affairs of a Kubernetes cluster. The control plane also contains other agents with separate responsibilities, and they help with cluster management too. Communication between users and the k8s cluster is done through the following means; the application programming interface (API), command-line interface (CLI), and Web user interface (Web UI). All these act as a channel for the user to send the requests to the control plane managing the k8s clusters. The control plane should be running at all times because it is an important service. Also, a disruption might result in downtime which may affect businesses as a result of data loss.']]}"

Bare Metal: K8s can be installed on premise bare metal hosted on top different os. Cloud Installation Kubernetes can be installed on almost any cloud production environment. A few of them are listed below. Hosted SolutionsWith Hosted Solutions, any given software is completely managed by the provider, while the user pays hosting and management charges. Popular vendors providing hosted solutions for Kubernetes are (listed in alphabetical order): Alibaba Cloud Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK) Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) DigitalOcean Kubernetes Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service Oracle Cloud Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE) Turnkey Cloud Solutions Below are only a few of the Turnkey Cloud Solutions (listed in alphabetical order), to install kubernetes on an underlying IaaS platform such as: Alibaba Cloud Amazon AWS (AWS EC2) Google Compute Engine (GCE) IBM Cloud Private Microsoft Azure (AKS).

      "We can stop minikube with Minikube stop Accessing Kubernetes Kubernetes cluster can be accessed using the following methods 1. Command Line Interface (CLI) 2. Web-based User Interface. 3. APIs from CLI or programmatically . CLI Kubectl is the only kubernetes command line interface client that is used to manage cluster resources and applications. It is easily integrated into other systems, can be used in a script or for automation. Kubectl has to be configured with the credentials of the kubernetes cluster before it can be used. Web-based UI Kubernetes has a web based UI that is used to manage, monitor, and containerize applications and resources in a cluster. API server This is the main component of the kubernetes control plane, its responsibility is exposing the kubernetes APIs. These APIs allow users to interact with clusters directly. The CLI tools and Dashboard UI can be used to access the API server and perform various operations on the nodes.\n",

Service discovery and load balancing: Containers receive their own IP addresses from Kubernetes, while it assigns a single Domain Name System (DNS) name to a set of containers to aid in load-balancing requests across the containers of the set. 5. Automated rollouts and rollbacks: Seamless roll out and roll back application updates and configuration changes, constantly monitoring application health to prevent downtimes. 6. Storage orchestration: Mounts software-defined storage solutions to containers from local storage, external cloud providers, distributed storage, and network storage systems. 7. Batch execution: Kubernetes supports batch execution, long-running jobs, and replacement for failed containers. Architecture Kubernetes contains the following components at a high level 1. One or more master nodes. This is part of the control plane. 2. One or more worker nodes Master node: The master node is responsible for providing a running environment for the control plane. This control plane manages the affairs of a Kubernetes cluster. The control plane also contains other agents with separate responsibilities, and they help with cluster management too. Communication between users and the k8s cluster is done through the following means; the application programming interface (API), command-line interface (CLI), and Web user interface (Web UI). All these act as a channel for the user to send the requests to the control plane managing the k8s clusters. The control plane should be running at all times because it is an important service. Also, a disruption might result in downtime which may affect businesses as a result of data loss.\n",
